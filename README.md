This is a painfully simple web page that goes for the *Kanban* look. There are three panels. One shows you what you're working on in big letters. The other panels have your queue / todo and your archive / done lists as just plain old text.

It's built on top of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/). Since there is no database server attached, data persistence comes in the form of JSON import/export buttons.
