==========

This is a web page / web app that provides a painfully simple *Kanban* board. There are three panels. One shows you what you're working on in big letters. The other panels have your queue / todo and your archive / done lists as just plain old text.

It's built on top of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/). Since there is no database server attached, data persistence comes in the form of JSON import/export buttons provided using [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/).
